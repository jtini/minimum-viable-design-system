# Minimum Viable Design System
This is a very barebones design system.

## What is this?
In a nutshell, this project combines [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Style Dictionary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary) to provide a starting point for a design system. By default, it only includes a foreground color, a background color, and a decision about which font to use.

## Why?
This project provides a starting point to create a design system that's equally useful to designers and developers. By default, it generates CSS variables and creates a static website that can be hosted anywhere. It can also be extended to generate SASS variables, code for iOS or Android apps, or just about anything else (check out Style Dictionary's docs for more info). This project is intentionally agnostic of design tooling and the static site that it generates should be equally useful to a designer regardless of which tool they use.
